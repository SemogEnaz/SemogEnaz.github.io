Through reading this guide, you will come to know what I do for diet and training.

    I use the PPL (Push, Pull, Legs) and I do it 2 times a week.
    See the below for details on each workout.
    We start on Monday with Push, so the week would look like:

         ~:Monday: Pull
          Tuesday: Push
        Wednesday: Legs
         Thursday: Rest
           Friday: Pull
         Saturday: Push
           Sunday: Legs

           Monday: Rest
          Tuesday: Pull
        Wednesday: Push
         Thursday: Legs
           Friday: Rest
         Saturday: Pull
           Sunday: Push

           Monday: Legs
          Tuesday: Rest
        Wednesday: Pull
         Thursday: Push
           Friday: Legs
         Saturday: Rest
           Sunday: Pull

           Monday: Push
          Tuesday: Legs
        Wednesday: Rest
         Thursday: Pull
           Friday: Push
         Saturday: Legs
           Sunday: Rest~:

    ~@Push
        Chest, Shoulders, Triceps
    
    ~@Pull
        Back, Biceps, Rear Delts

    ~@Legs
        Quads, Hamstrings, Glut's, Calves, Abs

    The main benefit of PPL is that it groups related muscles together in the
    same workout. This is good because I ideally want to train a muscle twice
    a week, or at least to the greatest degree that that is possible.

~!Diet
    Something I have been struggling with for like going on 2 years. I finally have 3
    dishes that I can eat on a somewhat consistent basis
