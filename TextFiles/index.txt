Through reading this guide, you will come to know what I do for diet and training.

    I use the PPL (Push, Pull, Legs) and I do it 2 times a week.
    See the below for details on each workout.
    We start on Monday with Push, so the week would look like:

           Monday: Push
          Tuesday: Pull
        Wednesday: Legs
         Thursday: Push
           Friday: Pull
         Saturday: Legs
           Sunday: Rest

    ~@Push
        Chest, Shoulders, Triceps
    
    ~@Pull
        Back, Biceps, Rear Delts

    ~@Legs
        Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves, Abs

    The main benifit of PPL is that it groups related muscles together in the
    same workout. This is good becuase I idealy want to train a muscle twice
    a week, or at least to the greatest degree that that is possible.
